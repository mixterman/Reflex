Getting started. Looks golden.
Old versions: old solutions and mistakes
Git commits: manual full logic control and clear view. Prone to user error
Git multiple files commit: interdependance, unlikely to screw upother files and VC allows to reverse mistake
Git log and git diff - easy find ur version (if u write messages in comit)
Git cheekout - AMAZEING no fear of commit cause u can checkout early versions quickly
Why git? for money
